![Petition-Pronto Logo](docs/PetitionLogo.jpg)

A work-in-progress system that will allow students to upload a petition for a
change in, for instance, their graduation requirements. Along with giving faculty
a way to vote on the petition, this system will then automatically notify
students of the result of the vote.

To run the project website locally, first make sure you are in the `src`
directory and have Python3 installed.

Then, run the program by using the command:
```
python3 app.py
```
